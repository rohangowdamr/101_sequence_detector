Finite State Machine is a mathematical model used to represent the behavior of a sequential system with a states and transitions between those states.

Depending on how the outputs are determined, we have two types of machines:
 1. Mealy Machines - Output depends on present state and input. 
 2. Moore Machines - Output depends only on present state .

 | Aspect                   | Mealy Machine                                           | Moore Machine                                          |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Output Dependency**    | Outputs depend on both current state and input.         | Outputs depend only on the current state.               |
| **Timing of Output Changes** | Output changes can occur immediately in response to input changes. | Output changes occur only after state transitions.  |
| **Number of States**     | Mealy machines often have fewer states.                  | Moore machines may require more states.                 |
| **Synchronization**      | Can be more prone to synchronization issues.             | Generally more predictable and less prone to synchronization. |

# Application

1. **Communication Protocols:**
   - Utilizes Finite State Machines (FSMs) to define behaviors ensuring correct and predictable communication between devices.

2. **Traffic Light Control:**
   - Applies FSMs to model and control traffic light systems, ensuring efficient traffic flow at intersections.

3. **Vending Machines:**
   - Employs FSMs to determine responses based on user inputs and current states in vending machines.

4. **Sequence Detector:**
   - Utilizes FSMs for detecting specific patterns or sequences in data streams, applicable in digital communication and error detection.
